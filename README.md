## How to Use

This weekday planner is an great tool to help you plan your work-day. The current time and date will be displayed at the top and will update with every refresh of the page. You can click on the hour blocks to add the tasks you need to do for the day. Upon clicking outside of the boxes your tasks will be saved to local storage and will stay there upon a refresh of the page. No need to click any save buttons, the app will save them automatically. During different times of the day the current hour-box will appear green to determine the current hour, gray to determine the hour that just past, and yellow to determine the hour next to come.
